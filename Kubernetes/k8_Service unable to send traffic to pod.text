in kubernetes service exposes the set of pods via stable endpoint(  ip+port)
service uses selectors to group pods and kube proxy to forward traffic to them
kubeproxy forwards the traffic only to pods that are in both
Ruuning state
Ready

What could go wrong?
If no healthy Pods are available, the Service has no endpoints to route traffic.

Causes could be:

Wrong label selectors in the Service

Pods not in Ready state

Pods stuck due to issues like:

Image pull errors
