SLA is a document which is having SLO(service level objects)

service should be running 99.99% throught the year.
response time will be 30 ms.

we do SLA with the customer. and there are someone who  taking care to meet this SLA 
there is dedicated team who always work on to meet the SLA

IF Service level objectives(SLO) are in risks then they should send alert to the development team or they should take required 
action. This team also called as site reliability engineer.

observability -- is important to ensure SLO are met or not. obervability is the framework that tells SRE engg. if the SLO are meet

                  SRE engg. configure metrics for the objectives. they create dashboard to ensure the metrics are met or 
                expectations are met.
                2) LOG- ELK --They set up log environment that is ELK stack
                3) Trace - And they also enable distributed tracing.
Incident management - As SRE engg we should be good at incident management. because sometime metrics fails ans immediately you would get alert. so as SRE enginner we would also setup alertand this alert received may be in the night or in day. so we need 
to know how to manage incident.so we need to respond to customer within SLA.
