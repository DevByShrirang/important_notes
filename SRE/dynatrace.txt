Dynatrace 
observability platform

observability
===========================
metrics + Trace(APM +Syn +RUM)  +  lOGS



Metrics - to monitor system and infrastructure performance (cpu, memory, resonse time), infrastructure monitoring like linux
          windows apache mysql tomcat this are the metrics you want to get it.
Traces - is used to understand application behaviour
     APM-appplication performence monitoring  for backend services
     Syn- synthetic monitoring to simulate user journeys and test availability
     RUM- real user monitoring -to capture actual user experience.

Logs- To provide detailed context for events , errors ,and anomalies.

suppose real user login to application and connected and use it and we want to record response time experiences so for code level
traces APM will help you.
Network level traces synthetic will help you
if you want to captures users sessions for the analysis. from country users are coming. what is the operating system
what the browsers they are using . how much time they have spending. on wchich pages they have spending all these information
getting through RUM.

Logs - windows logs , linux logs apache logs.

We collect above data and with using this data we set alert and dashboard.

from infrastructure monitoring we get it Metrics 
from application and microservices we get APM
from application security and digital experience we get RUM.

**********************************
i install oneagent script provided in dynatrace dashboard. i run it as root
i used flags like --set-monitoring-mode=fullstack  for full stack visibility. monitor infrastructure + application + services
capture deep telemetry (trace log metrics ) for full observability.
and --set-app-log-content-access=true  this allow agents to collect application logs content for full monitoring and troubleshooting .
helps in ctreating log -based metrics and alerts in dynatrace.
once installation done the OneAgent auto-discover services, collecting , logs metrics traces and report them to DynaTrace cluster
for visualization and alerting.

when we install oneAgent multiple background 

Installation :-
1) Dynatrace installation --
Installation path- Path: /var/log/dynatrace/oneagent/installer/installation_984.log
this is the detailed log file of oneagent installation process. 
2) Installation location- /opt/dynatrace/oneagent
on this path all oneagent files are installed it includes binaries , configuration files. this is heart of agent.

3) Kernel Dump hook (Crash handling) -
Line: Adding entry with oneagentdumpproc to /etc/sysctl.conf

this entry modify core dump setting so that dynatrace can collect crash dumps from monitored process. its part of 
deep monitoring and helps in application-level dignostics.

4) oneAgent Watchdog -
Binary: /opt/dynatrace/oneagent/agent/lib64/oneagentwatchdog
Config: /opt/dynatrace/oneagent/agent/conf/watchdog.conf

oneAgentWatchdog is critical process. it ensures other agent components are always running. if any monitored process fails 
or becomes unresponsive the watchdog restart them . it read configuration from watchdog.conf file.

5) Agent Runtime logs:-
Path: /opt/dynatrace/oneagent/os

This folder stores OneAgent runtime logs. it includes logs from the agents communication with the DynaTrace server ,
data collection process and auto injection diagnostics. its my first stop when troubleshooting performance monitoring issue.

*********************************************************

Dynatrace showning below information in overview.
up time of server.
if server launched using aws cloud then its also showing monitoring type and data center name.
showing availability , logs  eventsn , SLOs
Showing connections 
Network analysis 
Disk analysis.

Host overview - Host overview page showing information of system metrics , network stats , disk usage , process level data , 
and health checks all in one place.

1) Monitoring type & availability-
Monitoring type full stack - one agent tracking everything infra metrics , os process , service , container , logs
availability - percentage of time where host is monitored by OneAgent.
up since - shows when the host was last rebooted or when the agent came online.

2 ) CPU usage -- shows user ,system , iowait , and idle time.
helps identify CPU bottleneck and inefficients applications.


3) Memory used - 
used memory - active application memory
Reclaimable memory - can be realeased by kernal when needed.

Memory pattern helps in tunning applications and predicting OOM (out of memory) issues . Reclaimable memory gives us buffer
insights under pressure.

4) Network trraffic-
shows real time bandwidth in and out.
with the help of network traffic we monitor throughput per interface to detect anomalies like sudden spikes (possible DDoS) or 
drops (Service crash or misconfig)

5) Disk analysis -
disk analysis showing total disk space , used space and available disk space 

-******************
Dynatrace doing below all things-

infrastructure monitoring 
performance monitoring
log monitoring 
synthetic Monitoring
wrong monitoring
network monitoring
security monitoring.

we store the data and on top of that we can do analysis alerting , slo tracing and everything.
