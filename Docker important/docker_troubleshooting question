Troubleshootting issues in Docker-


ðŸ”¹ Question 1: What does the 'Container is Unhealthy' status indicate, and how do you troubleshoot it?

Ans:
- The unhealthy status means that health check command specified in the dockerfile is failing
- inspect logs docker logs container_id
- review health check command that it is correctly implemented and accessible within the container
- container dependencies varify that all dependencies require for all health chck are available and functioning

ðŸ”¹ Question 2: What causes the 'Docker Cannot Connect to the Docker Daemon' error, and how do you resolve it?

Ans:
- This error occurs when docker client cannot communicate with docker daemon
- check the docker docker daemon (systemctl status docker)
- Permission issue Ensure your user is in the docker group by running sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
- Environment variable Ensure the DOCKER_HOST environment variable is correctly set, especially in remote Docker setups

ðŸ”¹ Question 3: How do you fix the 'Docker Image Pull Backoff' error?

Ans:
- This error occurs when Docker fails to pull the specified image.
- check the image name/tag 
- Network issue
- Registry crediential while pulling the image from docker registry

ðŸ”¹ Question 4: What is the cause of the 'No space left on device' error in Docker, and how do you resolve it?

Ans:
- This error occurs when host system runs out of storage space
- Clean up unused container/images (docker system prune)
- check Disk usage use df- h to identify disk usage and free up the space
- Increase Disk size expand the disk size on the host machine,if possible 

ðŸ”¹ Question 5: How do you resolve a 'Permission Denied' error when accessing files inside a Docker container?

Ans:
-This error typically occurs due to file ownership or permission issue
- Run container as Root try running the conatiner with root privileges using docker run -- user root <image_name>
- Change the file permission by chmod or chown within the container
- mount option when mounting volumes ensure that the correct permission are set the host directory


ðŸ”¹ Question 6: How do you fix the 'Docker Bind for 0.0.0.0:80 -failed port is already allocated' error?

Ans:
- This error occurs when the specified port is already in use
- stop conflicting containers identify and stop the container using the port with docker ps and docker stop <container_id>
- change Host port modify the port mapping to use a differenthost port e.g. docker run -p 8080:80 <image_name>
- Release the port use sudo lsof -i:80 to find and stop any process occupying the port 

ðŸ”¹ Question 7: How do you resolve the 'Docker Cannot Start Service- Mounts Denied' error?

Ans:
- This typically usually occurs due to incorrect or restricted mount point 
- verify mount path ensure the path you are trying to mount exists and has the correct permission
- Use valid bind mounts ensure that the bind mount syntax is correct e.g. docker run -v /host/path:/container/path <image_name>

ðŸ”¹ Question 8: What causes the 'Docker- connection reset by peer' error, and how do you troubleshoot it?

Ans:
- This error often occurs due to network connectivity issue between docker container or docker docker daemon and external service
- Check docker network settings are correctly configured
- Firewall Rules verify that firewalls or security gruops are not blocking traffic
- container resource limit ensure container have sufficient resource and are not being throttled or killed

ðŸ”¹ Question 9: How do you resolve the 'Docker- Layer already exists' error during a docker build?

Ans:
- This error can occur when docker tries to reuse an existing layer but encounter a conflict
- clear build cache: use "docker builder prune or docker build --no-cache" to avoid reusing cached layer
- inspect dockerfile ensure that the dockerfile commands are correctly defined and that changes are necessary to create new layers.
- Rebuild image try rebuilding the image from scratch to resolve any cache issues.

ðŸ”¹ Question 10: What causes the 'Cannot Delete Docker Network- Network has active endpoints' error, and how do you fix it?

Ans:
- This error occurs when you try to delete a network that still has active containers connected
- List Active containers : Use "docker network inspect <network_name> to see which container are still using the network
- Disconnect Container: Disconnect the containers from the network using "docker network disconnect <network_name><container_id>
- stop/remove containers: stop or remove the containers if they are no longer needed, then retry deleting the network.

ðŸ”¹ Question 11: How do you resolve a 'Docker- Unknown instruction in Dockerfile' error?

Ans:
- This error occurs when the Dockerfile contains an invalid or misspelled instruction
- Check instruction syntax ensure that all instruction in the docker file are spelled correctly and in uppercase
- Dockerfile version compatibility ensure the dockerfile syntax is compatible with docker version 
- consult docker documentation as reference.

ðŸ”¹ Question 12: What is the 'Docker- Cannot kill container' error, and how do you resolve it?

Ans:
- This error occurs when docker cannot stop or remove a container
- Force stop: use "docker kill <container_id> to forcefully stop
- Remove the force : use "docker rm -f <container_id>" to forcefully remove the container
- Check container state : Ensure the container is not in paused state before trying to kill it 


ðŸ”¹ Question 13: How do you resolve the 'Docker- invalid reference format' error?

Ans: 
-when the image name or repo format is incorect also 
-try to check the image name and tag in right format then also check the repository name and tag as well 
-remove invalid character in image i.e. any special character during image creation
-repo name should be as per docker naming convention 

ðŸ”¹ Question 14: What causes the 'Docker- Cannot connect to Docker Daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock' error, and how do you fix it?

Ans:
- Docker client is not able to connect with  docker daemon either the daemon is not running or user running the docker command
  does not have permission to access the docker socket file. /var/run/docker.sock
- check the the status of the docker by using docker status command
- also try to see the permission which allocate /var/run/docker.sock has correct permission
- sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
- add your user to docker group sudo usermod -aG docker $USER 

ðŸ”¹ Question 15: How do you troubleshoot the 'Docker- Container Exited with Code 137' error?

Ans:
- it indicate that the container was terminated due to an out-of-memory condition or manually killed
- Increase the memory limit adjust the memory limits for the container using --memory and --memory-swap flags
- monitor the container resource usage with docker "docker stats" and ensure its not exceeding available memory
- Optimize Application - Review and optimize the application running inside of the container to reduce memory consumption(multi-stage-build).

16) What will you do when build fails at certein steps.
- i first look closely to the terminal output of docker build command.  docker build usually points to exact line in the dockerfine where the error occured.
if the build fails at COPY package.json . then i immediately check does package.json atually exists in the same directory where i am running the command.
If the failure is during RUN npm install that suggests maybe i used wrong base image.so i will confirm FROM instruction has the right image.

17 ) Docker Compose Service Canâ€™t Connect to Another.
    In docker compose all services are using same default network.
    in docker services are communicated with each other using service name as hostname.so the first thing i will check whether the services trying to connect 
    using the same hostname.
    web service ---DB service using localhost in the cconnection string-wrong
    web service ---DB service db:5432 -correct
    db container starts running doesnt means its ready to accept coonection but web server running and trying to connect db server.but db isnt fully
   initialized yet. to handle that i either use tools like wait-for-it.sh to delay my app start until the database port is open.
   i will check dockers healthchecks combined with depends_on .
